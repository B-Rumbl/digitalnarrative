                The Search for Consciousness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Perhaps for as long as humans have been able to grasp the concept of consciousness, they have sought to understand the phenomenon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Explaining the nature of consciousness is one of the most important and perplexing areas of philosophy, but the concept is infamously ambiguous.
                <br>
                <br>
                Western philosophers, since the time of Locke and Descartes (a French mathematician, scientist, and philosopher who expressed in the dictum “I think, therefore I am” ), have struggled to understand the nature of consciousness and pin down its fundamental properties.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tufts University philosopher Daniel Dennett names human consciousness "just about the last surviving mystery,” explaining that a mystery is something that people don’t yet know how to think about.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some philosophers attempt to explain consciousness directly in physical or neurophysiological terms, while other philosophers offer cognitive theories of consciousness, whereby conscious mental states are reduced to some representational connection between mental states and the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Core Device is an artwork and exploration of this mystery through the digital medium of 3d modelling and augmented reality. By letting go of a particular outcome of creation and allowing the state of flow to come into consciousness it allows an artist, creator, musician, actor etc to enter a mindful state of play.
                <br>
                <br>
                Play allows the mind to escape the preconditoned reponses of adulthood and allows us to step back to a time in which our minds were filled with wonder and playful curiosity, two of the most important elements in an artists repertoire beyond the creative skills themselves.

                Art is Play
                <br>
                Play is Meditation
                <br>
                Meditation is Pure Consciousness
